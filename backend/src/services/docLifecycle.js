/**
 * Document Lifecycle / State Machine.
 *
 *  Phase-8 introduces strict ERP statuses for every sales document.
 *  The actual schema enums on each Mongoose model are kept
 *  backward-compatible (so historical rows still validate), but every
 *  status mutation in a controller MUST go through `assertTransition`
 *  defined here. Illegal transitions throw a structured
 *  `INVALID_TRANSITION` error so the frontend can surface a clear
 *  message instead of corrupting the lifecycle.
 *
 *  Each document type has:
 *    - `aliases`       legacy → canonical status mapping
 *    - `transitions`   from-status → list of allowed to-statuses
 *    - `terminal`      statuses from which no further transition is
 *                      allowed unless explicitly noted
 *
 *  Reverse-flow rules (Part 2 of the Phase-8 spec):
 *    - Sales Invoice CANCEL is allowed iff `paymentReceivedAmount = 0`
 *      (enforced in the invoice controller, not here).
 *    - RTS CANCEL puts qty back into Allocated (handled in flow code).
 *    - OA CANCEL is rejected if any RTS already exists for that OA
 *      (enforced by `assertNoChildDocs`, used by the controller).
 *
 *  This file is **pure** — it does not touch the DB. It is safe to
 *  call from middlewares, controllers, or tests.
