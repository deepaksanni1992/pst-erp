The Supplier shall not disclose such information to any third party without the prior written consent of the Buyer or any unauthorized party. Any unauthorized disclosure shall be deemed a breach of contract and may result in legal action, including claims for damages and recovery of costs. Breach of contract will trigger UAE legal action and Middle East supplier ban. The customer also reserves the right to take legal action in supplier's respective country of operation. The Supplier warrants that all goods supplied shall be free from defects in material, workmanship, and design, and shall conform to agreed specifications. The warranty period shall be on minimum 18 months from the date of supply. During this period, the Supplier shall, at its own cost and without delay, repair or replace any defective goods and pay for all damages caused as a result of the failure. This warranty is in addition to, and does not limit, any other rights or remedies available to the Buyer under applicable law. The Supplier shall deliver the goods strictly within the agreed timelines. Any failure to supply on time may result in cancellation of the order or the imposition of penalties for delay, at the discretion of the Buyer, without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available under law.
